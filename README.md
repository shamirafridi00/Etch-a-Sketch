## Thinking

### UI

1. In UI there will be a color picker to addup any color
2. There will be a rainbow button for generating ranbow color input
3. There will be a eraser button
4. there will be a clear button to clear all the grid
5. There will be a range bar to give range between 1x1 to 64x64 grid


### Functionality

1. First I will create a grid based on the input
2. That input will come from the bar value input and default will be 16x16.
3. default color will be black but a user can be able to pick the colors and that color will also go into grid.
4. when the user will click then it will draw a cell.
5. when user will select the eraser button then on clicking the spot to remove, only that spot will remove
6. clear button will clear all of the grid.
